# Unity_NodeGraphSystem

A Graph system built from nodes - There are several types of nodes where each node can only connect and be connected to other nodes of the same type.
Connection between different types of nodes is forbidden unless the node is a 'bridge' node.
'Bridge' nodes can connect to any nodes type, ofcourse they can also be connected from any node type.

For preview and example how to interact with the system see 'Issues' tab.
